# pythonProjects
As I'm learning python I will share anything I think might be of use.

Projects started on but not quite completed:

Tweet message and image on Raspberry Pi start up
Word Classer - uses dictionary api to find word class or a word(s) inputted by user
Excel spreadsheet reader to set up random/fixed groups of children
